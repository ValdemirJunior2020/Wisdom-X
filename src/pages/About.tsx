        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          Wisdom X Stroke Foundation was founded by a software developer who
          survived a massive stroke on January 20, 2020, caused by COVID-19.
          Despite doctors predicting he wouldnâ€™t survive, he defied the odds and
          turned his life around. His journey from being a stroke survivor to a
          software developer is a story of resilience, faith, and determination.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Now, he is dedicated to helping other stroke survivors by raising
          funds and providing the support they need to rebuild their lives. His
          mission is to give hope to those facing the same challenges he once
          did and to prove that life after a stroke is not just possible, but
          can be extraordinary.
